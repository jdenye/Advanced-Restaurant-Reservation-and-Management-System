# Advanced-Restaurant-Reservation-and-Management-System
Advanced Restaurant Reservation System is a microservice-based backend built with Golang and MongoDB. It manages restaurant reservations, user authentication, and real-time table availability. Features include Google Maps integration, business insights for owners, and scalable, secure architecture.
Advanced Restaurant Reservation and Management System (Microservices Architecture)
# Project Overview
The Advanced Restaurant Reservation and Management System is a backend solution built using a microservices architecture to manage restaurant reservations, customer interactions, and business insights. It provides users with the ability to discover restaurants, make reservations, and receive notifications. Restaurant owners can manage tables, view analytics, and respond to customer reviews, all from a scalable, efficient system designed for performance and security.

This project showcases my expertise in backend development, system architecture, API design, security, and deployment. The system is developed using Golang and MongoDB with multiple integrations such as JWT-based authentication and Google Maps API for location services.

Key Features
1. User Management:
Registration and Authentication: Users can register and log in securely via JWT-based authentication.
Role-Based Access Control: Separate functionalities for customers, restaurant owners, and admins.
OAuth Integration: Supports Google OAuth login for ease of access.
2. Reservation Management:
Real-Time Availability: Customers can book tables and view real-time availability.
CRUD Operations: Create, update, and cancel reservations.
Notifications: Receive confirmation and reminder notifications (via SMS, email, or push notifications).
3. Restaurant Discovery:
Google Maps Integration: Users can find nearby restaurants based on their location and get directions.
4. Restaurant Dashboard (For Owners):
Business Insights: Restaurant owners can view analytics such as reservation trends, peak hours, and customer demographics.
Table Management: Monitor and manage real-time table bookings.
Review Management: Respond to customer feedback directly from the dashboard.
5. Performance and Security:
Caching with Redis: Frequently accessed data is cached for improved performance.
Security: JWT for secure authentication, encryption of sensitive data, and role-based access control.
Scalability: Microservice architecture with containerization (Docker and Kubernetes) for horizontal scaling.
System Architecture
The system is built on a microservice architecture that decouples the various components, improving scalability, maintainability, and flexibility. Each service is independent, loosely coupled, and communicates over HTTP/REST.


# Core Microservices:
1. User Service: Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management.
2. Reservation Service: Manages restaurant reservations and table availability.
3. Restaurant Service: Manages restaurant details, analytics, and owner functionalities.
4. Notification Service: Sends email/SMS/push notifications to users.
5. Location Service: Integrates with Google Maps API for restaurant discovery and directions.

# Additional Components:
1. MongoDB: Stores user data, restaurant details, and reservations.
2. Redis: Caches data to improve performance during high traffic.
3. JWT: Token-based authentication for secure user sessions.
4. Docker/Kubernetes: Containerizes and orchestrates the deployment for production environments.

# Technologies Used
1. Programming Language: Golang
2. Database: MongoDB (NoSQL Database)
3. Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens), Google OAuth
4. Microservices: Golang-based microservices with REST APIs
5. API Documentation: Swagger (for API documentation and testing)
6. Caching: Redis (for performance optimization)
7. Deployment: Docker and Kubernetes (containerization and orchestration)
8. API Integration: Google Maps API (for location services)

# Getting Started
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

# Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the following installed:

1. [Golang](https://golang.org/dl/)
2. [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
3. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
4. [Redis](https://redis.io/)
5. [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) (optional, for API testing)

# Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/jdenye/restaurant-reservation-system.git
cd restaurant-reservation-system
2. Set up environment variables: Create a .env file in the root of the project and add the following variables:
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017
DB_NAME=user_service_db
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
3. Run MongoDB: Ensure that your MongoDB instance is running.
4. Run Redis: Start your Redis server.
5. Run the application: Use Docker or run the services individually: go run main.go
6. Access the API: The service will run on http://localhost:8080. You can test the endpoints using Postman or any API testing tool.
